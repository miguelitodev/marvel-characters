<h1 align="center">Characters Marvel 🔥</h1>

<p>
    Hello, this is a test project for a Junior-level ReactJS front-end position, this project makes the request and listing of characters from UMC (Universe Marvel Comics), in addition showing about the selected character his description and participation in comic books. Within 6 days to develop this project, I had to study several contents, even so I managed to finish on time, it was a great pleasure to use this API, link in the references.
